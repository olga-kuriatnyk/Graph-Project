# Graph

Graph class with several graph algorithms including depth-first search, 
breadth-first search, dijkstra's shortest path, minimum spanning tree

I use clang-tidy to ensure the program adheres to C++ standards
and clang-format to check code style.


## Included Files

- `vertex.h, vertex.cpp`: Vertex class

- `edge.h, edge.cpp`: Edge class

- `graphtest.cpp`: Test functions

- `main.cpp`: A generic main file to call testAll() to run all tests
